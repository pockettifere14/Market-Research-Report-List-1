<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Fan Clutches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Thermal Fan Clutch</li><li>Thermal Fan Clutch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive fan clutch market consists of two main types: non-thermal and thermal fan clutches. Non-thermal fan clutches operate based on engine speed, engaging or disengaging the fan to optimize cooling without thermal influence. In contrast, thermal fan clutches use a bi-metallic or electronic mechanism that activates based on the engine temperature, ensuring optimal cooling performance when needed. Both types are essential for maintaining engine efficiency and preventing overheating, contributing to improved vehicle performance and fuel efficiency.</p></p>

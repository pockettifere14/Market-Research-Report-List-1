<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Exhaust Gas Scrubbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ship exhaust gas scrubbers market comprises three main types: open loop scrubbers, closed loop scrubbers, and hybrid scrubbers. Open loop scrubbers use seawater to wash exhaust gases, discharging treated water back into the ocean, suitable for deep sea operations. Closed loop scrubbers, in contrast, utilize a recirculating water system with added chemicals to neutralize pollutants, allowing for operation in sensitive areas. Hybrid scrubbers combine both systems, offering flexibility to switch between open and closed modes based on regulations and operational needs.</p></p>
